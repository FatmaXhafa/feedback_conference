It is good after the conference to thank them, to tell them how it went, how well we advertised them, etc. to partner again.It's bad the board fell.Let's think about how to attract more people, although the guests of this conference knew what they came for and did not behave with profanity.The distribution of the debt was very good and everyone knew what to do.We should be more careful to select the speakers. We need people to be presented as Dimitar Simov and Zlatin, more than people with exciting history, but weak speedmakers like Roobar.The panels are too long.Let's keep in mind that we're all understress, and we have to stick together, not make a mess.Evala Toshev!Praise for all departments for a job well done!!! AydeisThe people on the team to be inside during the presentations, not the outside.To have prepared questions and to be active as Theo – ""Rock  Star"".To promote asking questions. Let's put a link to the platform for questions on the bouclé.Our poster is as big as the musical's.To promote the subjects of the lecturers, which would lead to more guests.Let's distribute flyers to themes and speakers while we sell tickets!!!""Let's take more beautiful members."" -Gerry To have better shots of the speakers.Did we get drunk?Conflicts with other events and parties – as early as possible to keep the conference date sothat the musical and everyone else can comply with us.A day's conference?They all liked the variety of themes.Smaller sessions with lecturers where the most shy to ask them questions.The conference is February, not march? Okay, but when it's the first week after vacation, no one's comighome.Is Boukleett better or a flyer? The flyer can be  put  in the pocket, but there are no themes, which is bad.Information and contacts for all lecturers, sponsors, media, etc., in order to have continuity between the members.All lecturers are our potential partners!!!The Alumnitata have liked our conference more than theirs: DA better and interactive site to be able to find in Google  earlier than now.Do not forget the picture of Annie in the site: DLet's contact the media early to reflect them in the flyer and be able to release press release earlier , not all in the last week.It's super cool that we're all united, and everyone can turn for help or anything, and we're not in camps... Evala, this is about the first semester exits!The technique for the first time is so enviable.We're doing better than people who deal with it!!!When the conference is the week after the vacation it sucks that the organization should be happening with chats, calls, etc.The Organisation for the conference should start from the previous semester!!! Let's give the speakers a pass and invite them in early so they can send us their themes on time.Communicating with the lecturers will happen only through the lecturers section, so that there are no misunderstandings, as with the presentation in Bulgarian this year!Let's think about getting people out of campus.More serious connections with startups such as Betahouse, accelerator,etc., which is a much stronger advertisement and eventual partnership  than an article in equity!!!We were super calm. We have not run wehave created the impression of the Super organized team of students who do  everything with spirit and desire! Speakers say this is one of the coolest conferences!!!Very good spam!Lectures are in English is a very good idea.Let's invite speakers who are foreigners!Boy and girl for leading required!What will happen to our email domain? Emails through the Gomler, who are already a sponsor of startblocking?Everyone is impressed by the team! Thanks for the cool meetings and events!|2016 100003|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iNQyAY-KiStMVzm31OGz6REmAfoNCW1T/view?usp=sharing|Feedback_SC_2017|StartUP Conference 2017 Feedback SessionIt's better with shorter presentations as it was.To educate speakers on how to use a clicker.The Evala of the IT people, very well done, thank you for running.Marketing team is an alien!!! 38 thousand Ream!!!It is very good to contact larger companies and to prepare them individual species, materials, etc.Nobody on the team was nervous, everyone knew what to do.To do confirmationearlier, advertising and contacts with people earlier.Excellentwork on the tasks,  teamwork was very easy and enjoyable.The lecturers were much better than previous years.Technical faults are close to magic.The speakers like Leona and Daniel were boring. Too much motivational spigotCurry.Notes games were cumbersome. Getting areward and withdrawing it will happen in  another way.Let's charge for tickets.Collective decisions taken at a meeting do not change at the last moment – the live stream in a partier.The regiment is great. Much better than the chair.They're not thatbig of a general. Similar  motivational stuff.People from the club don't come out during classes.Respect for all!!!Good for the photographers!!!Each one of us has the schedules all the time. Like the weekend!Yes, there are people who can point to the photo-Buuta.Individually, to encourage and to thank you. An important part of the team spiritWe don't have many foreigners. Let's target them better.This year the audience has been more active.To know better about what they 're going to talkabout......Leading to cigarette butt ordoasking questions.We're very positive and cool. We are not sinless, but we are  real!Tickets are good to have paid. The money we collected for a donation.Let's warn the spikins and direct them to teach us something. To be able to draw something out of their shoulder, not just to speak for themselves.Good for Mimi! Fast and continuous making and uploading of photos is a key.One of the most memorable withis e experiences  of many of the people in the team, which is the most important!!!Bravo to the moving  team. Very professionally it looked breakfast, lunch, coffee breaks and everything.To have a stationary computer on which to upload presentations, not speakers to bring their own laptops.We have a thematic conference! The Idea of General Conference is corny.Let's change our target group, because the AUBG people already know about us.Guests outside of AUBG are very satisfied.The themes of speeches are not common things that we all know.To have a selection process for the speakers.Yes there are foreigners lecturers. Not only are Bulgarian names that will attract foreigners from AUBG30 Nader 0site, from whereto attract foreignersand. Catalina proposed this,  She will explain.CRM is very important.The program is in the first place and on the site andeverywhere!LinkT with the questions to be on the screen!Very COOL ADVERTISING materials!!!! Posters , etc.Well done, everybody.We're doing an   admishens favor, whining  about money  very hard.A combined ticket with the musical.A lot of students want to study here!!!Let's not talk loud at the door, let's not leave during the lecture. People who speak well in public. Workshops and raffle are great, but explain them better.A double-edged sword for students. See 51.People from the audience were noisy and they don't know how to behave, they make fun of English.The draw of the petals.We're super-Nadhali, Evala, team spirit.To have the program and the physical banners around the hall.Last year we had speakers who were telling personal stories, which is very valuable. To encourage them in this direction.Prospective data students are very important!The direction of happening and organizing things is the right!!!First we accept questions from the audience and then online.To advertiseme  workshops earlier to be filled.The ticket system. One ticket for one email, not 3 names with one email.Bravo for donations!Criticism of being on a topic conference as it will be exhausted.""""It was orgized,  as an organization, by the organization  just great!!!"""" MoniOne of the lecturers to help the others. For example, Boris Hristov or another pub speaker to work with others.The people on the team stay inside so the room is full. If we're not there, then who's going to be there? Let's visit the workshops, and let's not hurry to fix our room.The problem with the recording. Earlier, a continuum. There were people whohad fallen  to them and  refused to come. Very bad!Toshev to train people fromthe technological perspective, as well as the Bratovankata people with photographers.Do not release the video ad to an empty hall, be announced by the presenters.Sixty and Nine Hee-hee.Let's learn a few, so we're not like the administration.Do mp over each other people from teama, who are in front of the stage.Let's figure out a way to communicate between us. The phones may be distracting,  but they help us keep in touch during the Iventa.Let'shhem The program on the board of the Ashur, for example.Let's read!!!! Like a Bible! win a Bravo awardThe Conference one day. To discuss in one meeting important things like whether to have a topicTo be more emotionally shutting down than the leading and from us as they all leave. Let's have a drink and listen to some music, notIncontinunbut chalga.Our Facebook chat has been seen on the main computer. People who only deal with the target audience. Separate department only for this. We've all been helping Mimi, and we've responded right away.To have the famous people to finish the conference or to find it. SoWe don't leave or just come for them , whichwill be awkward for the lecturer before or after them.I have a pin on Facebook with the program and perhaps the speakers info.The language barrier was too high. At one time there was no one on registration, which is not cool.The Bratovankata and Vicky have been very motivated and since the first meeting they have Nadhali all very successfully.The pictures for the sponsors were very cool!!!!!!Statistics for the guests, as the companies that we contact will be cool.Alumni tradition is very cool and we have to stick.Let's increase our guest seats.Only 60% of free CONFF come after they have confirmed.The coming of the conference would require   a little more participation from the candidates, such as writing something creative or something  Individual praise for every one of the marketing department. Beautiful designers beautiful work days. Bravo to Kali for the script!Marketing people have had no list but jump straight to the ground with the tasks they have checked out.Well done to Mitaka for all the things he did. I don't want to list them, because I'm going to forget something, and I don't want to. Bravo one more time.Timing of the conference. It's not after the music, so we can go in early and prepare a clicker, etc.Let's not show our nerves because it's transmitting to the others.Otnošeniâto by Canteen is outrageous. How can you give us the charm of a tablecloth? Let's talk and maintain a good relationship with them to help us.Very good bocutting this year, which we can use for recruitment,  sweatshirts, etc.The organizers can sit on the last line so as not to make such a bad impression when we leave.To convey our ideas for lecturers, we have over 20 cool proposals.Let's invent something original; More celebrities.Let's not forget to keep our room and do it as early as possible.Vicky and the bratovanata have exploded well!!!Tickets to be paid for outside persons only.We have very quickly solved the problems that have sprung up because we are wonderful and unique!!!Oshte za  feedbacka  ama  da ne  spamq:  Kato  setvame  mikrofona  da e  setnat  da se  zapisva  za  dve  slushalki  zvuchi  stranno  ama  dogodina  Kato  go  vidq  shte  se  setq ??AZ Imam Feedback Kum Budeshtite hostove Tui Kato Sega Editvam videata i kogato se zadavat vuprosite nqkoi ot lektorite izlizat ot kadur, problema ne e v choveka s Kamera zashtoto cqlata scena e obhvanata...

Thank you to Stankov and Toshev, Rado for the many chats and posts to keep us notified and our three leaders for the devotion and the hard work. Great organization, attendance of the tickets could be improved by making the people pay before they come. Could be improved: some kind of a change in the stage because is the same every year and we don’t do it in the last minute There should be a place where lecturers who already spoke can talk to people that were interested or did not have time to make questions. Amazing conference, great organization. Suggestions: -Making sure that people come we should have an actual ticket. -Engage them in lotteries by putting them to places which have stamps on. -Sequence of workshops, speeches, workshops, speeches so that they could be more engaged. -Give more time to speakers, especially if they are international, because Ash came from the US to have a 30 min speech, so that they have a better chance to show themselves. -Certificates of participations for the audience members. -Remind the people more often about the lotteries, for example before breaks because many people did not participate. -Participants can win tickets 2-3 weeks before the conference by making some sort of contest (social media or whatever). It was better that it was for one day only, workshops were very liked by the people so we could make more workshops for the people and could be implemented so that people do not go home after, the speakers were good and their English was good as well, everyone put effort. Workshop of digital marketing was interesting but it was not a workshop, it was a lecture. Useful but some people fell asleep.  Angel Kurtev sucked. Next year we should continue to diversify, not stick to the same thing, continue to improve. Technical part has to be figured out better, because it was Toshev’s brilliant idea which came from experience which made it all possible. We should invest in streaming equipment (suggestion:couple of hundred dollars from a Chinese website). We have to make sure that speakers are microphone trained. They were shutting them off and what we can do is use Push To Talk apps for iPhone or android to communicate with each other so that we don’t have to run on the stairs back and forth.  We could have a separate guy responsible for microphones.  Positive things: - very good organization this time! we were absolutely perfect at timing, no delays, which was amazing - I really liked that the conference lasted one day - I think we didn't ""lose"" our audience like it usually happens on Sunday morning - the cocktail was a great idea - we had some technical problems, but I liked the kind of funny way we solved them Things to be improved: To be honest, this was the best organized conference so far in my opinion. Yet, we can improve some things: - I think our speakers were great!!! However, I think that when choosing speakers next year, we can make slightly different choice. For example, I really liked the speeches of Ivan (not because he was my speaker) and Ash. They were more interactive and more interesting. I think we need to target speakers that have more to offer to the audience, not just to talk about their revenue ... my point is that we can concentrate not only on how much success speakers have achieved, but also on the approach they will tell their stories - for instance, Ash told his story of success in terms of meditation, Ivan concentrated on self-improvement I think this would be great because we will be showing the startup spirit and success through different lenses, more interactive and interesting I am not saying that the speakers we had weren't good - they were all great (maybe the second one not so much) but still, just thinking in a slightly different direction so that we can attract even more audience. The guy from the digital marketing workshop (one of the founders of StartUP) was very impressed with the club. More people on registration wanted to have spots on workshops so we need to promote them more because not everyone checks their mails, game for free tickets before the conference, schools were a great idea because there were prospective students who were very enthusiastic about it. Technical part-recruit!! Keep workshops mainly in the beginning, people are more concentrated and have more energy, perfect timing with the photographers. Strongly encourage people in the next year to previously prepare the posts. We should emphasize more on the games and the idea behind the palette of innovation (just like with the dragon). KEEP ONE DAY CONFERENCE! Not mix workshops and speeches, its gonna be chaotic, we could have more workshops but still, in the morning. For registration, people had to be there all the time, that is bad. We should set a limit and concise time. Getting bracelets in people’s hands were hell. Think of something else for example the rubber bands. We should have had more posters and more presence, there were too little things making us recognizable.  Maybe not use small schedules and make big posters with schedules. We could add stickers on the tiles to show people that we are there and where they can go for the event. After the conference, we should have gone earlier in under to prepare everything. The bracelets can be used for people to have free entrance in under. Organize games during the aura bday to give tickets for startup. Charity box: money you put should be in proportion to the possibility of winning as an incentive to put more money, there was not a person at all times in the charity box.  Rado will send to me Tech-checks Q&A system  and google forms for the workshops- research it well and do it as soon as possible and ask questions like this on recruitment  create IT department IT part more conscious to develop the website even better or step up and develop an app Separate guy for q&a session Some guy came and got sandwiches, left and he was not even part of the conference so there should be someone checking if people have bracelets or not Stage ideas in advance Topics and speakers much in advance so that we put schedules next to posters in skaptos, not only on the day of the event.  Stand up to sponsors, Zdravets was extremely annoying. We should send the packages in the second email when we talk to sponsors. Hosts timing delegated perfect, keep it up  - Tasks delegated – structure as much as possible – as much roles as possible – and time coordinated (registration)  - Read feedback;essential  - 3 workshops before - Definitely don’t think workshops have to be in between lectures  - format lectures  - lecturers trained checked mic – this has to be in the communication with the lecturers  - conference prepared from fall (speakers and sponsorship can work earlier – sponsorship even before recruitment)  - Heads and leading people tutorial(instructions) on the new management body  - Experiment and risk  - We will have equipment bought – recruit what you need  - Can consider sponsors’ logos on t-shirts as a bonus  - The conference kept a constant or even gradual interest engagement and audience presence throughout the lectures  - Analyze why the positives worked and repeat them, and improvise with the things that did not work out  - Questions link on the schedule worked perfectly  - Emphasize on merchandizing  - Keep registration organized (money, drinks, personal stuff)  - Great idea for Aspire being a spot for lecturers talking with audience in between lectures  - USE THE CRM EVEN FOR SPEAKERS (communication is better and you keep all the info there) SPONSORHSIP you have more than 200 sponsors potential on there with their emails and phone numbers. You can track even who were our previous sponsors, for some of them how we contacted them, why some rejected, what others gave us…etc. Keep it up, it is easy  - Cocktail worked out good. I recommend keeping it next year. Great opportunity to get the people networking with each other and with lecturers. Important note: You might have not seen this, but 3 people are needed 20 minutes before the cocktail to pour the wine upstairs. This is what Rado, Mladen, and Chapi did, and we left right before Ash’s (last speaker)’s Q&A started, so that we can make it for the closing speech  - One thing I regret is not having more meetings to brainstorm all these details that I think of post-factum. Have that people (next heads). Think through all the possibilities in advance. Be creative, be initiative. Congrats. In general my feedback to the whole event would be the following. I said most of the things after the event on the stage to the people there, I believe by the time you get to read this most of the things regarding the organisation would  be adressed.  I heard what most of you guys think can or should be better for next year and ideas on how to do it so in that aspect i believe you have everything covered quite well. My brief opinion on how everything went is that it was as close to perfect as we got so far. Congrats to everybody for functioning as a well oiled machine and looking professional, coping with the stress and all the issues extremely well. So organization wise and process I trust you all know better than me how everything is supposed to be done and areas that need improvement. My main feedback is not to focus all your attention on the small scale things such as the 30 people lost audience because of the MUN or that the musical were not promoting the sale of our tickets. Those are small issues that would be figured out. Focus on how to bring this event to the next level, not only local but national, how to expand it to the broader audience around the country and how to reach people interested in it. Look at what we do as a StartUp itself, we have reached a state where our product is good enough for a larger scale. Try and find a way to either innovate and add more value to the event itself but also think and try to penetrate new markets. What I mean is to aim to get people from Sofia, RUSE, Varna, etc to come and attend. We have connections to similar organizations around the country, try capitalize on them to bring people who are passionate and actually interested in this event here and not just the casual AUBG and alumni audience we get every year. Why not have the second day devoted to highschool student only and educate them to this subject for example. That would be my advice to all the people for next year, bring the focus on how to expand and make all the alumni jealous and proud of how much better you made the club. To conclude my lengthy speech, I would say it was an amazing event, well thought and executed, of course there are areas where it can get better. Keep taking risks as in terms of speakers, spending, sponsors, bring more internationals and don’t be afraid to risk and fail because I firmly believe the conference and weekend will only get better because of the risks and mistakes we made previous years. You guys are awesome and thank you all for an amazing weekend! – Chapanov Ajde Lord To6kata is here Stand up to sponsors The Hub uses apps for communications. – Slack & Trello Trello master position in the club Make people use them. When you are at work you use the software the company uses. Social media behind: very good. Photographers had easy access to marketing ppl. Have tables for the marketing ppl. Talk w/ speakers to stay for cocktail. Posts early preparation. Should stay like that. If possible even earlier. Thank you letter. Mimeto thinks sponsors would like that. I think so as well. Velko coming in: couldn’t we get the speakers a real quick interview. Milena did it wohooo, have someone do that next year as well. Promo video: do it, keep the files for next years, and do it so that others can use it easy after you and modify it so that you don’t start from ground zero every time. More women. The second speaker was actually not bad. People have different opinions. One day conf good idea. No redundancy + AUBG people are more willing to attend + people from other cities are more willing to come. Recruitment: find video-editing people. Thank you from Kali. Most negatives already addressed.  Still, we need physical tickets. We are a serious conference.  Sacrifices needed from the members and registration should not be sacrificed.  Marketing: theater scene to be thought out earlier. If we have the $$ - do not pay only Blagoi but the lights person so that we can have fancy effects and look professional.  Sponsors: stand up to sponsors. The hotel we had as a sponsor wanted too much for what they gave. Plan the conf from earlier. Conf + Weekend can be planned in parallel. Target banks early for conf, bc it can bring more general sponsors. We should not have to sacrifice a whole spot for an appointed person (MusalaSoft). Bracelets: they did indeed slow down registration. If $$ available: make them rubber bands. Freeriders: appoint someone to make sure that people without bracelets are kicked out of the theater in a polite way. Go to schools in parallel if there are enough people to do so. Do not go to Toshev or whoever it is with random requests. Like, someone came and asked me to fix a presentation while I was doing tech things, when obviously Milena or smb from Marketing who makes presentations can do it better and faster. Remember: StartUP, not start-up, not StartUp or whatever. Maybe work with Uzu somehow?? Another plus for earlier preparation of the conference is that it allows for the announcement of the speakers before starting to sell tickets.  On the brigher side: Kudos a lot. Next year we will be OK. Speakers: many risks. But it all payed-off. Maybe Ash wasn’t the best speaker, maybe his cost/benefit was not the highest, but given the circumstances he was the only international speaker and we did well taking him so that we did not end up with Bulgarians only. Overall Kali’s best year in the club.  Department tasks were divided really well. Should always be done like that. Kudos to speakers, very good work. Marketing: awesome work. Everybody was really involved and during events they knew their tasks and even people who were not in marketing were helping without event having been asked and Kali feels like she did nothing because of that and she feels awesome about it because it feels like we trust each other and that there is a lot of transparency this year and people are genuinely good and respectful towards each other. Every year we can have misunderstandings. Every family has feuds. But do not let personal feelings get in the way. Marketing has 4-5 sub-departments and needs 2 heads. Much work to do. Every week. Constantly. Thank you to all heads for the support of Kali because she is a little bit more like that and to all the dragons lizards snakes whatever around her. Milena: she was against 1 day conf but she was wrong. One of the best decisions we had taken. Marketing: more promo materials. Poster for event as big as the musical’s. Conference was really chill organizational wise in comparison to before. Recruitment: take people you think you can work well with. Do not take people if you think they are assholes even if you need them (ex. Do not take IT only bc u need IT, judge the person as well). Do not take friends only bc they are your friends. Kudos to all departments. Lecturers who couldn’t come: Contact them again. Lecturers: look at speakers from other events. Even if it is a long shot. Spam as early as possible. Everything is online, just do it. Sponsors: kudos. We could get an international speaker and we still have $$ left. Best year in the uni.  Best conf. Very worried, but once everything started: calmness. It just happened. And it happened well. Viki thinks of smth. Opens chat. Sees same thing already mentioned and done. Well-oiled machine. Have a good atmosphere so that everyone feels good. We have not had such a good recruitment. Many people. And quality people. Chaos for the new members, especially freshies, but every new member was contributing a lot. 9 people worked on cutting the stickers out. Much kudos. The conversation about Ash: heated but shows that people care. Nobody pays us. We do it out of own interest. We trust each other. We should be a university club, but we do real things. Believe in yourselves in next years that we do things that matter. You have the level to do negotiations with sponsors, speakers, media, etc. Do not bow down to them. We are very precise in doing what they want. For 2 years now. Zdravets gave so little and we had to do so much for them. Negotiate. We are a real organization with 100+ audience. Do not be afraid to ask for what you deserve. Negotiate because we take risks like Ash Kumra, which gives us leverage for later years. When you say StartUP conference people should know who we are. We are getting there, but there is still work to be done. Hosts: Guy + Girl aways goes well. The script was great. 3-4 people contributed to it. Creativity to the max. Evala kudos.  IT: when we are there Viki is calm. IT: Start early. Ash: good idea to take him. Every speaker contributed w something unique. Every was memorable. Because only 1 day conf? Because speakers chosen so well? Brainstorm the schedule beforehand. Workshops work well in the beginning so the theater can be prepared for the speakers during the morning. Also schedule the speakers so that they flow well in terms of topics, if possible. Sponsors: good job. Everything on point. Food beverages wine etc: Make sure it is laid out beforehand and ready for the event. Sacrifice your time from watching the conference if needed to make sure the tables are set up and everything. Do not do everything yourselves. Delegate work. Kudos to Viki for delegating. We grew this year as a club. Trust each other.  Marketing: best year so far. Kudos to all. Much creativity. All the work well delegated. Much motivation. Same people, if you do not approach them they can close off. So, need to talk with people well and give them appropriate work. The mark of a good leader. The dragon was awesome. So was the conference. Great attention to detail.  Take good marketing people. Some of them would be good if they can draw well. Try to work with other clubs. The cocktail was great. Good work with rjc as well.  Musical joint ticket: a good first step. Needs refinement. Do not be rivals, you can work well together. Start working early on. In short: Viki is really proud of every single member. She has no words to describe StartUP (note the capitalization). She will remember this year forever. Thank you all for this hard work. Everyone did their best.   PLS READ ME LATER  "|2018

As much as I loved Omar and his charisma, his speech was only partially (or not at all) related to sustainability.  Involve participants in the marketing strategy to increase awareness on campus. This way the spamming will not only come from StartUP or members’ accounts but from participants themselves (i.e banner pictures - great idea, should have put more attention to it). Prepare the workshop classes, ABF and bags the night before - great idea, continue, if possible even earlier. Should print some extra tickets if we decide to sell on the conference day again.  Eli:  I think the efforts that we put in the details from the design of the venue and the stage to the small StartUP flags in the sandwiches <3 were much appreciated so we should keep being creative and come up with new great ideas for the next year. The marketing campaign around campus was more than amazing!  The idea of having a common theme that sets the overall atmosphere and connects everything together worked really well.  Having Melanin was something innovative and interesting and it would be great if we can contact local young entrepreneurs to do a showcase next year as well.  We should keep the idea of having many workshops throughout the day. The cocktail outside was wonderful and professional.  Gathering up Friday night and doing everything in advance was extremely helpful.  Maybe for next year, we can try to organize a dinner after the cocktail for us and for the speakers that would stay.  Gathering up earlier Saturday morning would be better because we would be in such a hurry and stress right before the start of the event.   Ivy: KUDOS to everyone, we all did a really, really great job!! Good job to Speakers for finding such awesome people -- there wasnt a single bad speaker imo Regarding the workshops -- it should be very clearly communicated to the speakers how long the workshop should last; maybe make sure they have clocks if need be Re: Flavia’s feedback -- I also think it would be nice if all the speeches were coordinated with the theme but I understand that it’s also up to the lecturers we bring, and not up to the people in the department  I like having a theme BUT it would be nice if before settling on one the Marketing (and Designers, if we’re keeping it) department got the chance to have a say in the theme. I am SUPER proud of what we did, and I am glad we set an example with sustainability, but it was really, really difficult to come up with a concept and a design that matched the theme of the event -- still, GREAT job, everyone  AWESOME job, Sponsorship -- especially whoever contacted Chuska and Cupffee I feel like we should make sure some things are done WAY in advance -- we lost so much time doing things in the last possible moment when we could’ve done them much earlier - e.g. the crossword, putting the certificates in frames, the sponsors’ logos etc.  Great work to everyone in Marketing, I love you all  Partly, scratch that, totally my fault -- but the script should have been ready in advance, so the hosts would’ve had more time to practice; also, should’ve done mock q&a sessions so the hosts would be more comfortable doing that  I liked having the cocktail outside -- but it was a bit chaotic, and there weren’t enough glasses, which some people brought up  I know we can’t force people but it would be really nice if everyone was more… available? On several occasions I would try to reach people and I needed them IMMEDIATELY and they would take forever to look at their phone -- and I can’t send telepathic messages but it would be nice if everyone would check their phone more often and keep in touch with the rest the whole time  Would’ve been nice if we had started announcing speakers earlier -- we posted so much and so often that FB marked it as spam and wouldn’t let us post any more 3D posts, maybe if we’d spreaded them out more evenly, this wouldn’t have happened  Don’t know how specific this is -- but we should’ve made sure in advance that the dispenser was working  I feel like I should stop because I wrote like a ton of stuff :D but ah well  4th department were AMAZING; they had to deal with so much crap from the speakers and they had to think on their feet and act super fast and they did it -- gg  We need to have a way to communicate with the audience better -- I feel like if we have the app this will be OK, but there were some off parts this year -- we had no adequate way to reflect changes in the schedule, not everyone looks at facebook for updates, etc.  It was nice that we had the schedule on the screens, but I feel like we should’ve had it on more places, more detailed, etc.  Great idea for Melanin & the 3D guys -- let’s do it again but with more startups  I think overall it was amazing, let’s just communicate with each other better  Everyone loved the workshops -- let’s keep doing this  When I said spamspamspam I really meant it -- with 30+ people in the club if everyone (and not just the 5-6 people who regularly did) had shared/liked the posts, we could’ve doubled our reach  We mentioned it before the conference, and we kept doing so throughout the event -- but please ask questions?? There is, like I said 30+ members, it is not that difficult to have at least one person per speaker who asks a question so we avoid situations like the one with Niki where Nikol had to improvise Task distribution is absolutely amazing, made the whole flow of the event almost flawless BUT everyone has to be on the same page about  e v e r y t h i n g. I absolutely love how much the board insisted on transparency this year, so @ next year’s board ? keep it up! But there was still stuff not everyone was in the clear about  There is task distribution for a reason, people NEED to do WHATEVER they’re assigned WHENEVER they’re assigned it  I am also guilty of this but DEADLINES are super super important, everyone should respect them  There should be better communication between Marketing & Sponsorship when it comes to what the sponsors want during the event; the spreadsheet was great, it would’ve been amazing if we’d had it earlier than we did  This might be the third time I’ve mentioned this but it’s because it is EXTREMELY important -- communication between AND within departments is key! Everyone in the department needs to know what’s going on in the department, and what’s going on in other departments  @ Designers, it would’ve been better if everyone was updated on how the stage and the hall were gonna look - a lot of people were surprised, not necessarily pleasantly  I know I’m going back and forth but re: the cocktail; we should make sure it’s set up in advance; people were coming out of the theater and to the cocktail, and there were empty glasses, and the participants were standing around waiting for us to fill up the glasses, and it was kind of awkward I know we tried to do this this year but we should try harder -- have someone guide where people are sitting or assign seats or sth so that there arent huge empty areas  Some other basic stuff -- clean up after yourself, make sure all the tables are neat and nice, maybe figure out a place to stock cardboard boxes and stuff; this was a MAJOR issue during the weekend, it was better this time around -- but there was still half empty bottles and half eaten stuff just lying around and it’s not very professional y’know  GREAT idea to collaborate with CAP -- once again, there should’ve been better communication (i shoulder the blame, should’ve talked to Tsveti in advance, and we should’ve prepared stuff beforehands); it was a great idea, the execution was not so great -- people just ignored the labels and threw their shit wherever --- maybe have like a general recycling area separately and not keep the recycling bins right next to the food so people will make more of an effort? Idk GUYS I HAVE TO WRITE MY PAPER BUT I KEEP COMING BACK AND ADDING MORE STUFF :D  As for selling tickets -- let’s not do it next to some other club selling tickets, or find some better way to differentiate ourselves I might have more to say but I can’t remember rn so I’m gonna stop, THANK YOU all so much for the amazing experience, I love you ALL so much  Also if you’re sitting in the front rows for tech/host/assitance/any other reason PLEASe be aware that you should WHISPER and overall talk to each other only if it’s really URGENT  I didn’t mean to add so much feedback sorry :( Natalia  Great job, everyone, I really liked the team spirit, the motivation of each and everyone of you and how we managed to work as a team - keep that spirit next year too. Tasks distribution is a very efficient and convenient way to make sure that everyone has their task, knows how to do it, where and when is needed and it’s easier for the other to find a particular person if they just look at the spreadsheet  Having a topic - great idea, keep it because it looks more professional and even more attractive to people to attend the event (I got feedback from people who came only because they like and associate themselves with the topic) Having not only the marketing campaign, but also sponsors connected to the topic in a way was a great idea, looks professional and consistent  Keep the workshops, people loved them, but MAKE SURE that they are workshops in real - there are tasks, energizers and engagement from the attendants because as much as I know Cliff’s and Donald’s workshops were more like lectures IT department - amazing job! KUDOS <3 The apps were great, amazing, marvelous idea, just make sure that they work and are approved at least a week before it’s time to be used  Deadlines - this is for the board next year - guys, give deadlines and make sure they are met; this year there were way too many things that should’ve been done earlier - the speakers and the workshops, the app, announcing the speakers of FB should’ve started much earlier and we should have been ready with the design much, much earlier; the games, the certificates, the script, the website platform….next year just make sure that you plan accordingly and everyone meets the deadlines, so that you don’t spend sleepless nights  Poster with the schedule & THE TOPICS OF THE SPEECHES & WORKSHOPS  The crossword game - really nice; for next year keep the games interactive and audience engaging like that  Good job for NOT stressing out, that’s one of the reasons why the event went so smooth  Keep the cocktail outside; the idea for having a StartUP cake was great; keep it People, be on time - everyone said they will be there in 8.30 and when I went in ABD at 8.30 sharp there was only 3 people - Blagoy (the IT guy), his colleague and Cliff; most people came around 9 which was way too late and that’s why we were a bit stress at the beginning  When printing the labels for the workshops (the ones that we hang on the doors with the name of the speaker and the topic), make sure that all of them are correct (because instead of Ventsi we had a label for Bogomila who was a speaker) Keep the registration tables clean (no coffee, no snacks, no jackets - have a separate small table for that) and the food corner ALWAYS restocked Hosts - great job!  Selling tickets - fill the slots and PERSUADE people    Vankata Overall, it was amazing <3 We all did a terrific job The marketing campaign was dope, we attracted so much attention with the banners, stickers and posters around campus and this was the best way to promote the event The spamming strategy was on point RE: Ivy and Flavi - Omar was amazing indeed but it would be nice the speeches to be coordinated with the topic (again is not up to speakers department, you guys found wonderful speakers) Having a theme for the conference was a great idea, we should keep doing that Preparing everything the night before was of great help, it could be done even earlier if possible next year Things went mostly smoothly during the day, having all this space in front of the hall helped a lot during the breaks  Having the app was a great idea Interactive games (such as the crossword) keep thing interesting and people excited Distributing tasks beforehand made the whole event go smoothly as everyone was calm There should be more coordination when it comes to how things should be (tables etc) because someone says they should be this way and then another person says otherwise The cocktail outside was cute, it is a good way to mark the end of the event. After a whole day in the auditorium the change of setting and fresh air are nice. Also the cake was just WOW The chalga break while cleaning up was a nice touch to the whole process The circle on the stage was heart-warming  ESTELA: •AMAZING marketing campaign around campus. Many people told me it was ?? .  •The IT department did the impossible with all the speakers’ presentations and little bugs with the microphones-good job guys, you have handled it amazingly. •The time management and the schedule was nice. I have found the idea of having both workshops and speakers great, and I think that people enjoyed it.  •Also, having the younger guys presenting their startUPs in Aspire was a good idea too. Many people went by, I think we should keep it for next year and invite even more startUPs.  •We should have more waters next year. (But this is just a small minus)  •Having the cocktail and cake outside was beautiful-we should definitely keep it, it gave the atmosphere and the whole event a final sparkle. ?? (chereshkata na tortata) •I don’t think the light bulbs in the Theater really worked out, they were not even noticeable and some of them fell.  •Overall, in my opinion the whole event was great, I will never forget it and I’m already excited for next year. Great job guys, you are all amazing!!  Love u, startUP??   Vladin BIG Thank you for the experience guys and girls, You are AMAZING! Negative Stuff (Read carefully) Speakers should send their presentations earlier. It is not impossible but it would be nice if we do not have to deal with them in the last possible moment as we are delaying the whole event. People did not like some of the workshops. Some of the opinions were extremely positive, some of the people said that they expected more. They lectures themselves were considered amazing. So we should discuss the workshops (e.g In Tihomir’s workshop people had to stop at the middle of the workshop as they did not have enough time). We should post the speakers probably a bit earlier and their topics as well because some of the people were wondering whether or not they should come. We should to move according to the schedule if possible. People were a bit annoyed because we were late. Please when you drink water/juice , eat smth. Do not leave the bottle or the packaging on some random place. There should be one person specifically who shows the speakers how to put their microphones (Kiril had a problem).   Nadia I just wanna say thank you again for the great experience and incredible team spirit throughout the last couple of weeks. I think everything went very smoothly. The marketing campaign was amazing, I would hear people talking about it allllllll the time.  Most of the speakers were really good. I think Omar and Niki created such a great atmosphere. It was a perfect ending of the conference.  The cake idea was great, but we started getting very, very frustrated trying to cut it in front of all the people, who kept pressuring Asya. Perhaps next year we should show it to people, and then take it somewhere to be cut and then served. Maybe next time we should have some questions beforehand, and we should somehow constantly remind the audience to ask questions, because by the time they start asking the q&a is coming to an end. Also this way the next host won’t be stressed like Nikol who kept refreshing the q&a feed before going out on stage. There should definitely be posters with the rooms and lectors of the workshops. People kept asking and running around and most of us didn’t know the exact rooms so we weren’t very helpful as well.  Otherwise, I think everything else was perfect. Everyone from the team was so happy and it was evident even for the visitors, which I believe really contributed to the spirit on the event.   Kalina  Very strong sponsorship. Office hours – turned out to be a great idea, which, of course, wouldn’t have been possible without the dedication of the department! Bravo for the initiative from Preslav and from the devotion from everyone! Logistics – another good idea. More time should be spent on preparing the stage, and not only Marketing department should be responsible. The stage looked VERY nice, much better than last years. Speakers – best so far as a group!!! This year had the lowest number of “weak” speakers, almost everyone was great. Do not have much insight or feedback on the workshops but I heard positive opinions about Ventsi and Cliff. Marketing – people LOVED the campaign, an advice for next year, maybe gather more in places with white board and brainstorm there. Overall, though, amazing team and leader! Everyone took initiative and were involved! LOVED the black cloths, very professional More people to take care of the space outside and clean up. The boxes and packages in front of the WC area should be cleaned up because it makes a bit of unprofessional impression. Good idea to make the cocktail outside after all. Was even more interactive and people liked it. Hopefully, next year will be as warm. At least two people at registration AT ALL TIMES. One person to serve as a „guard“, and watch out for people making noise in the audience, as well as people going out, again, at all times. I noticed Zhan trying to prevent it but I think there should be a “guard” both inside and outside at all times, so that this doesn’t happen at all. BEST, BEST EVENT SO FAR! Topped everything in retrospect. The team was in sync and very calm. Everyone was smiling, everyone gave out an impression that they are on top of things (as they were)! Amazing work! Velko: Overall the amount of kudos I've gotten from people that absolutely do not care about StartUP is speaking for itself. Amazing job. An amazing team. I love each and everyone of you. Thank you! Definitely keep up the good work IN IT and develop the app for next year to a perfect stage. Definitely a deadline for speakers in order to send their speeches + presentations + their preferred way of tech (mic or headset) so that the IT department will not go into frenzy. Incentivize the people to come to second panel of workshops.  Do not run up and down the stairs unless absolutely urgent. Looks unprofessional and is distracting. AMAZING job to the marketing department. Photos and descriptions were out of this world.  Don't get drunk too quickly in under Clean after yourselves. Check everything. The only thing we forgot to check was the goddamn dispenser and it was the only thing that didn't work. Build a speakers conspect (a new one) Check your phones regularly, someone may need you urgently and your lack of response may be of a great damage to the organization. If the weather is nice- definitely the cocktail should be outside. Great idea. Cocktail tables worked as well. Music all the time outside the theater. Definitely a short video of the speaker + photos Designated person to help the speakers set up and instruct them before their speech. Better social media games. (Start to plan them earlier) Video production + post conference video (really important for sponsorship) Send thank you sponsorship letters ASAP.  Spend more time to explain to the people in the registration desk how everything works.  Logistics is not logistics. Proofread everything Games implemented in the apps in order to popularize it. Critical thinking pls Definitely keep the QA talk  Be a proud StartUP member!   Pepo: Speakers should send their presentations earlier Speakers should try the clicker before going on stage Everybody should be on the same page More information before we start the event. (We didn’t know what the cassia tour prize is when we went on stage *still don't know* ) Video recap of the event Logistics dpt. was a great idea Focus on quality speakers rather than motivational speakers   Dari: -Time: The fact that the workshops were quite late and did not fit in the time provided, personally for me -looked quite unprofessional (it is ironic that people are giving “lectures” on how to plan and organise everything right and then they themselves cannot do it). Maybe it will be good for next year to give clearer and stricter instructions for their workshops/ speeches and expect from them to plan everything more carefully and precisely.  -Photographers: one of the speakers of the workshops was quite disappointed when he found that that during the other workshops there was a photographer, but during his there was not. I told him that maybe our photographer did not know that there is a workshop downstairs. But still that is unprofessional as we, the organisers, are the photographers, and thus, we should know where all the workshops are. -More water: know that more water was bought when it was discovered that it won’t be enough, but I think that as a general people were grabbing a lot of water and then leaving their bottles somewhere and coming again. I know that we cannot control how much bottles people take, thus, I think the idea of having a water dispenser could be a good solution. Or maybe we could give everyone a bottle of water at registration or put them in the bags. Thus, everyone can get a bottle and they can fill it later on from the dispenser. -I loved the idea about the post and the hashtags, yet I think next year we should encourage it more. -??????????As a whole I think all the departments did AMAZING! I lived the bracelets, the stage and the two sofas ??, loved the cups for coffee and the things from Leshtichko. Thank you everyone for making my first conference so remarkable and unforgettable?? I received such a positive feedback, from both the students and the speakers. The couple told me that for them the conference was 100 times better than last year - Sofia TedTalk ?? and were surprised by the fact that students did it for students.    Ilko: Constructive feedback: Trash clusters behind the food tables - suggestion: store everything in the sports hall via the back door of the hall itself Do visit the schools next year - mind their spring break Do try to popularise in Sofia - I personally had 4 friends coming from there saying that travelling and accommodation is not an issue at all (can speak with Admissions as well) Try to have the slots for selling tickets filled all the way - our work is all down to selling in the last 2 weeks prior the conference Dim the lights way more - stage was way too bright, theater as well Set-up time: if needed, no matter how unpleasant it will be - stay as late (early) as needed - even after 3, or 4 a.m. We left a bunch of things for the morning - we could’ve cleaned up a bit more and avoid stress in the beginning of the important next day. Also, having as much people as possible, if not everyone, will immensely help with running the errands. *Won’t be an issue when we do not have the musical prior the conf next year.* HAVE music - brings up to the atmosphere. Help more with re-stacking the tables. Positive feedback: We differentiated a lot this year - theme, app, website, guerilla marketing, setting, format, cocktail - keep innovating! “Best StartUP Conference I’ve attended; Professional; Smooth; Engaging; Intriguing; Consistent” Consistency between the theme and the products/items we had - noticed by a lot of people - kudos to Sponsorship - it means business. IT department - savages - devotion makes perfect. Evala. Logistics - all small touches were vital - cloths, tree, flowers, bulbs, everything - that contributed to the whole appreciation of the conference more than many of us understand. Lemonade was great! Cocktail - outside was a great idea. The spot was a great idea - however, we should spread it a bit more - space issues. Do RJC collab, music is a great touch. Speakers - continue their new policy about finding proven public speakers. Workshop/lecture balance was great - people didn’t get tired/irritated/bored. Have a celebrity and a “fun” Omar-ish guy Marketing - continue with the guerilla - we set our goals really high for next year - will need to push a lot more to jump over this year’s level. Team spirit is key. Be proud. We’ve done it, we are devoted, we are together. Help your peers, help is always needed. If you do not have things to do and see somebody doing something, but he doesn’t need help, just go keep him company. We should always be in high spirits.    Leman: -One of the best conferences I have ever attended for sure! -Starting with Friday, the day before the Conference, I think all people should come to help in order to be more efficient and finish relatively on time, so that we can be fresh for the Big Event. However, it was amazing experience to gather with the team and while doing some technical stuff, to bond, learn more about the members and understand that leaning on each other is crucial and we should support each other whatever happens.  -Boys could help with carrying the heavy stuff, not because girls are not strong enough, but in order to help each other more -The spirit was amazing, all the heads were so kind, even though they were stressed out and under pressure for everything that should happen during the event. The Conference was the moment when I realized what is StartUP to me, what am I willing to sacrifice in order to be part of this club; I had the same feeling on the Weekend, but this one was even stronger. -During the Conference, I think registration people should come earlier and we should always have two/three ppl in reserve in case one of the registration ppl is absent, but the idea with having two in the front - registering and two/one in the back - preparing bags and bracelets was very useful.  -The crosswords and other organizational things like frames, etc. might be prepared in advance.  -Amazing speakers, amazing hosts, amazing Q&A session (that was what differentiated us from others, I loved it), amazing decoration of the theater, amazing job! -Cocktail outside- brilliant idea -fresh air, networking, music, however, we might need more food for next year’s Conference -The cake with the arrow- eye-catching and gave the sense of very professionally looking cocktail! -We should spread out the tables a bit more next year, but it was very successfully organized- Logistics department - you are amazing <3. -Workshops were interesting in terms of organization, but i think the audience was not that much engaged what is happening, but rather waiting the time for the speakers to come. Other than that, flawless organization. -Concerning food sponsors, I liked them a lot, but have heard from other people that some of the products were not that much tasty or desirable. Let’s not forget, we gathered an unbelievable amount of money, compared to the past, congrats to our Sponsorship Department! It was an honor to be part of you, StartUP Family <3!    |2019
